          "TEAM ROLES"
Business analyst (BA)
Understands customer’s business processes

Translates customer business needs into requirements

A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements.

A BA enriches a product development team with a profound understanding of business processes from various perspectives and the ability to shape up a software product that creates maximum business value. A business analyst may step in even before a software development team structure is defined and continue to bridge the gap between the customer and the team during later stages of development.

Product owner (PO)
Holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution

Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements

Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog. Associated mainly with flexible Agile environments, a product owner is particularly useful in scenarios where requirements and workflows frequently change.

The responsibilities of a BA and a PO sound quite similar. What’s the difference between the two, and is there a need for both in one project?

The critical difference is that a product owner provides the vision of a product without diving deep into how it is technically implemented, while a business analyst bridges the gap between a customer and a team, being a bit more on the technical side. So, a PO is more customer-oriented, while a BA is often more focused on the technicalities of the project. Professional business analysts are usually qualified to take over some of a product owner’s tasks, like managing the product backlog and modeling workflows, among other responsibilities.

In outsourcing scenarios, a product owner can be someone from the client’s side, a startup founder, for example. They possess deep domain expertise but might lack technical knowledge. They can work in tandem with business analysts to fine-tune product requirements.

Project manager (PM)
Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget

Manages and motivates the software development team

In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.

In Agile projects where the focus is on self-management, transparency, and shared ownership, a PM sets up the vision of a product, maintains transparency, fosters communication, searches for improvements in the development process, and makes sure a team delivers more value with each iteration.

Some people believe that there’s no need for a PM in an Agile environment with similar roles, like a service delivery manager or a scrum master. However, if your company is running multiple Agile projects simultaneously, having dedicated PMs is vital. They would connect the dots between high-level stakeholder requirements and day-to-day task execution on a team level, while, say, a scrum master would manage the workload within the team.

UI/UX designer
Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs

Creates user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates

There are two aspects to the product design process—user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.

A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.

The UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is, thus, involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more. A UI designer, in turn, devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product.

A UI/UX designer would accompany you throughout the development lifecycle, helping you achieve business goals via functional and engaging user experiences, as well as analyzing, evaluating, and enhancing those experiences over time.

Software architect
Designs a high-level software architecture

Selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision

Sets up code quality standards and performs code reviews

An architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software design decisions on behalf of an app development team. You will need one if you deal with a software product with complex requirements or legacy software that calls for profound changes. A software architect decides which services and databases should communicate together, how integrations should work, and how to ensure that the product is secure and stable.

Software developer
Engineers and stabilizes the product

Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle

A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.

Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.

Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.

There are full-stack developers as well. They can handle all the work at once—from clients to servers to databases and all the needed integrations.

Quality assurance (QA) engineer
Makes sure an application performs according to requirements

Spots functional and non-functional defects

The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.

They evaluate an application from different angles—be it functionality, usability, security, or performance (hence, many types of testing). To keep track of the executed checks and ensure that all the requirements are covered with tests, QA specialists may create different kinds of testing documentation—from test scenarios to test protocols to test results reports. And experienced QA engineers design and implement quality assurance processes and procedures that help prevent defects at later stages of development.

Test automation engineer
Designs a test automation ecosystem

Writes and maintains test scripts for automated testing

A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.

A skilled test automation engineer would help you choose which parts of an application are suitable candidates for automation and what’s better to be tested manually. They would also design a test automation ecosystem that is easy to maintain and update. Finally, they’ll make sure that your test automation initiative generates as much value as possible at a reasonable cost.

DevOps engineer
Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams

Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery

Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.

1. Authentication
 Verifying a user’s identity (e.g., via username/password, OAuth, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication).


- Protects user accounts** from unauthorized access.  
- Ensures that only legitimate users can log in and interact with their personal or sensitive data.  
- Critical for all user-related actions, especially in apps involving personal profiles, dashboards, or cloud-stored files.



2. Authorization
 Determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do (e.g., role-based access control).

 
- Prevents privilege escalation (e.g., normal users accessing admin-level features).  
- Ensures users only access **data and actions** relevant to their roles.  
- Vital in admin panels, APIs, and enterprise-level features where different permission levels exist.



3. Rate Limiting
 Limiting the number of requests a user can make in a specific time frame.
 
- Defends against brute-force attacks (e.g., login attempts).  
- Reduces server overload and helps maintain app performance.  
- Essential for APIs, login endpoints, and form submissions to avoid abuse or DDoS attacks.



4. Data Encryption
 Securing data in transit (e.g., HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (e.g., encrypted databases).


- Protects sensitive user information (e.g., passwords, financial data) from being intercepted or stolen.  
- Mandatory for compliance with privacy laws like ]GDPR or HIPAA.  
- Especially important in **payment systems** and any app storing personal data.



5. Input Validation & Sanitization
